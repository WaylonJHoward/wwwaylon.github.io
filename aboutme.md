<span style="color:Indigo; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">A researcher's vision is often constrained by how they think about and use data.</span> 

<span style="color:Indigo; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">It is tough to watch researchers develop intricate theories about how the world works, which represent a lot of deep thinking about a topic, only to cut them up into smaller chunks that are then crammed into canned statistical procedures that were never designed to address the original question to begin with.</span> 

<span style="color:Indigo; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">Methodological advances allow us to ask more sophisticated questions. But *how* do researchers stay current with advances in methodology and data analysis?</span>

<span style="color:Indigo; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">I </span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**love** </span><span style="color:Indigo; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">to dig into all phases of research projects - from planning to publication. I work to identify and outline investment to build and maintain research capacity by **providing responsive, efficient, and high-quality analytical support**.</span>     
  
<span style="color:Indigo; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">My work includes multivariate approaches to measurement and analysis of substantive problems where I have led simulation-based research and contributed to recommendations for applied researchers. In addition, I have conducted substantive research using structural equation modeling techniques as a general data analytic approach to studying individual, developmental, and socio-contextual differences within the social, behavioral, and health sciences. I also have extensive grant experience in relation to study design, statistical analytic plans and power analyses.</span>

<span style="color:Indigo; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">To accomplish this, I support staff and systems to achieve sustainable growth in services, funding, satisfaction, and strategic partnerships.</span>    
  
<span style="color:Indigo; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">I have enjoyed many leadership positions throughout my career and believe that personal and professional relationships form the backbone of all sustainability and growth, and that a reflective focus on continuous improvement data informs good decision making.</span>

## <span style="color:CadetBlue; font-family:Palatino;">Research grants</span>    
<span style="color:Indigo; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">I have extensive experience in research study design, formulation of hypotheses and the preparation of statistical analytic plans, Monte Carlo simulation based power analyses, as well as basic and innovative statistical analyses as an interdisciplinary-oriented collaborator and mentor. I have served as a co-Investigator, statistician, or consultant on more than 15 grants and contracts (National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Science Foundation, etc.). I have also successfully organized, managed, and taught a week-long summer statistics workshop series including basic and advanced courses (total participants = 60)</span>
