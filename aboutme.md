<span style="font-size:1.75em">A researcher's vision is</span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Georgia; font-size:2em;">constrained</span> <span style="font-size:1.75em">by how they think about and use data.</span> 

<span style="color:Indigo; font-size:1.75em">It is tough to watch researchers develop intricate theories about how the world works, which represent a lot of deep thinking about a topic, only to cut them up into smaller chunks that are then crammed into canned statistical procedures that were never designed to address the original question to begin with.</span> 

<span style="color:Indigo; font-size:1.75em">Methodological advances allow us to ask more sophisticated questions. But *how* do researchers stay current with advances in methodology and data analysis?</span>

> <span style="font-size:130%">I love to dig into all phases of research projects - from planning to publication. I work to identify and outline investment to build and maintain research capacity by <span style="color:Black">**providing responsive, efficient, and high-quality analytical support**</span>. My work includes multivariate approaches to measurement and analysis of substantive problems where I have led simulation-based research and contributed to recommendations for applied researchers. In addition, I have conducted substantive research using structural equation modeling techniques as a general data analytic approach to studying individual, developmental, and socio-contextual differences within the social, behavioral, and health sciences. I also have extensive grant experience in relation to study design, statistical analytic plans and power analyses.</span>
