<span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">A researcher's vision can be constrained by how they think about and use data. It is tough to watch researchers develop intricate theories about how the world works, which represent a lot of deep thinking about a topic, only to cut them up into smaller chunks that are then crammed into canned statistical procedures that were never designed to address the original question to begin with.</span> 

<span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">Methodological advances allow us to ask more sophisticated questions. But *how* do researchers stay current with advances in methodology and data analysis?</span>

<span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">I </span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**love** </span><span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">to dig into all phases of research projects - from planning to publication. 
  
  
  I work to identify and outline investment to build and maintain research capacity.</span>     
  
<span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">My technical work includes multivariate approaches to measurement and analysis of substantive problems where I have led simulation-based research and contributed to recommendations for applied researchers. In addition, I have conducted substantive research using structural equation modeling techniques as a general data analytic approach to studying individual, developmental, and socio-contextual differences within the social, behavioral, and health sciences. I also have extensive grant experience in relation to study design, statistical analytic plans and power analyses. Typical software: **R** (Rstudio, Rshiny, Rmarkdown, etc.), **SAS**, **M*plus***, **SPSS**, **Stata**, **LISREL**, SciPy - **Python** (statsmodels). Specific areas of interest include: </span>
