<span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**Vision of the Future of Data.**</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;"> Who I am and what I do is always the result of responding to the perceived nature of the world as it is and the world as I see it becoming. My curriculum vitae represents a strategic response to both the world as it is, and what I think it is becoming.</span> 
  
<span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**Research.**</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">The nature of work and data will become less and less tied to place and time and more distributed. This will result in more opportunity to be strategic in our use of human and other resources to both mine data for meaning and to ask strategic questions of the data. It will also require additional skills in designing databases that provide us with the right data at the right time in a safe and technically accessible format. New technologies may facilitate individual and team use of data across time and in a variety of contexts that increase the cultural relevancy of the data.</span> 

<span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**Organizations.**</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">The changing nature of data with cloud-based storage and retrieval require developing skills to build in the cloud, and retrieve reliably from the cloud to effectively collaborate across distance and time. Leadership skills are needed to keep colleagues and personnel focused on organizational tasks while also monitoring the health of the data systems we use and the people using it. We need technical skills for collecting, analyzing, and using data in new and emerging ways to see answers to both emerging and posed questions. This requires techniques that look forward with data to identify and validate predictive models, and strategies to identify the most important outcomes for specific human efforts and look back at best paths to achieve those outcomes. These skill sets will require an expanding effort to combine basic research, complex clinical and other analytical models, data mining, algorithms and other predictive methods, as well as program evaluation and efficacy models. Emerging technologies will also provide new opportunities to effectively collect and use data for research, evaluation, and quality improvement purposes. </span> 

<span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**Work Life.**</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;"> These previous assumptions have led me to build experience and skills that promote my effective application and use of leadership and technical skills across diverse contexts. I look forward to finding the next challenge that will engage my unique experience and skill sets in a long term organizational and professional growth and adaptation to the world’s changing work life, data use, and emerging technologies.</span> 

### <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">LEADERSHIP BUILDING.</span> 

<span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**Leadership Mission.**</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">I have enjoyed many leadership positions throughout my career and believe that personal and professional relationships form the backbone of all sustainability and growth, and that a reflective focus on continuous improvement data informs good decision making. My mission as a leader is to support staff and systems to achieve sustainable growth in services, funding, staff/faculty satisfaction, and strategic partnerships. To acomplish this, I focus on a number of critical leadership effectiveness efforts including: strategic planning, productivity and quality, funding and partnerships, reflection, and mentoring.</span>

#### <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">PRODUCTIVITY AND QUALITY.</span>    
<span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">My</span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**personal service mission**</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;"> is to provide *responsive*, *efficient*, and *high-quality* analytical support. To accomplish this, I regularly collect detailed information about research activities. Analysis of these data typically invole the calculation of indicies that are helpful for assessment, for example:</span>   
   
* **Proportion of staff involved in grant submissions**
* **Number of projects per staff** and associated **weight** (workload) of each project
* **Number of grants, publications, talks, posters,** and other forms of dissemination
* **Stakeholder and peer qualitative feedback** 
* **Proportion of billable time** per staff relative to the position

<span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">These indicies are calculated at the group-level to evaluate overall group progress and at the individual-level to allow for individual progress assessments in comparison with previous results and with the anonymous results of other staff members. I am interested in influence and visability metrics within the orgainzation, the dicipline, and healthcare system more broadly and use automated procedures for indicators of productivity and impact (e.g., citation metrics, journal impact factor, etc.) using R, Google Scholar and other tools.</span>  

<span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">Figure 1 illustrates the development of scholarly activity based on select group-level indicies across three years of leadership. As shown in Figure 1, the team supported</span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**65**</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">grant submissions during the final year (Oct. 2016 – Nov. 2017), an increase from</span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**46**</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">the previous year and</span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**10**</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;"> from my first year with the team (July to October 2015). Pre-award grant work required close resource management to ensure fiscal sustainability.</span> <img align="left" width="450" height="250" src="/assets/img/BEEPacademics.png" alt="results plot"> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">This substantial growth was accomplished in part by increases in efficiency due to experience and focused training, a developing library of grant templates and power analysis code, and increasing demand for this service. Also, we increased the percent of staff involved in grant submisions from</span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**20%**</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">in 2014-2015 to</span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**80%**</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">in 2016-2017 with </span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino;">**60%**</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;"> of staff included as co-investigators on at least one grant proposal during the last year.</span> 

* <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.20em;">Qualitative grant reviews described our grant methodology and analysis sections as:</span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**innovative**, **clear**, **well-reasoned and appropriate**, **well thought out**,</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">and </span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**clearly indicated in the proposal in a highly detailed and concise manner**. </span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">Similarly the principal investigators summerized our work as:</span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**excellent**, **thoughtful**, **state-of-the-art**,</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">and </span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**perhaps the most thorough part of the grant**.</span>

<span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">Published manuscripts also increased with staff co-authorship from </span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**5**</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;"> in 2014-2015 to </span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**31**</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;"> publications in 2016-2017 (see Figure 1). Many of these publications were in top tier journals (some with an impact factor > 5). During the last year, team-authored publications were cited a total of </span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**783**</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;"> times, with a median of </span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**16.125**</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;"> citations per staff member.</span> 
   
<span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">Overall, Figure 1 illustrates </span><span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**the coalescence of a new vision for team leadership within the organization**</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;"> that resulted in new funding, partnerships, and additional value offered by the team.</span> 
  
### <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">TECHNICAL SKILLS.</span>   
  
<span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**Statistics and quantitative methods.** </span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;"> My primary area of research is the development of novel statistical methods to better translate the kind of benefits that you can understand from an experimental simulation setting into real-world settings where the application is often not so good. We have to solve all kinds of limitations. One of my main areas of interest has been missing data where I have led simulation-based research in this area and contributed to best practice recommendations for applied researchers. In 2012, I was awarded a research grant by the Society for Multivariate Experimental Psychology for the special emphasis of this work on multivariate approaches to the measurement and analysis of substantive problems. </span>

<span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**Over simplified data analytic practices within the social, behavioral, and health sciences.** </span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;"> Our vision of research is constrained by how we think about and use data. Too often we develop intricate theories about how the world works, which represent a lot of deep thinking about a topic, only to cut them up into smaller chunks that are then crammed into canned statistical procedures that were never designed to address the original question to begin with. I am committed to identifying such practices, providing modern demonstrations of their disadvantages, and explaining available alternatives, to discourage their further use. We often want to know how (mediation) and when (moderation) predictive relations hold or are strong versus weak or want more flexibility in examining change over time. To this aim, I have direcly collaborated with researchers to garner </span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**more than $5 million**</span> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino;">in new research funding and developed considerable experience applying diverse best-practice methods to complex problems in new areas. </span>
