Missing data is really an incredible area of research. It occurs in most areas of the applied sciences and knowledge of missing data can function sort of as a repair kit - so that you can avoid losing additional information when handling missingness. We can actually use missing data theory when designing studies to decrease participant burden and research costs. But that’s not what I want to mention here, because right now most statistical software programs have defaults that do not properly deal with missing data; also I am not confident that we are currently able to automate the handling of missing data because there are many important considerations. So let’s review a few of these missing data concepts and look at some examples.  

For those of you interested in further reading on the topics discussed today, I recommend John Graham’s article [“missing data analysis: making it work in the real world”](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5d13/841cf55efbab48663ca29ef8d8ffb3bb087f.pdf?_ga=2.59084654.296295912.1603138962-192597268.1603138962) – as the title suggests this is written with applied researchers in mind and I love that it covers a wide range of important issues. 

I’ve also noted some related publications that I have been a part of. The first published in the international journal of behavioral development addresses how we are talking about missing data – consider that "why data were missing" on your last study might be helpful to the next person in your field. 

The second article published in multivariate behavioral research – is more technical and addresses the gap that we sometimes find between best practice theory and what is actually possible to do on a computer in your office right now.
