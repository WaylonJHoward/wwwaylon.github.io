I am a Quantitative Psychologist by training, which means that I’m trained in research methods, statistics and measurement. I have a number of areas that I have worked in over the last several years, mostly pertaining to longitudinal latent variable modeling; 
so I’ve done a lot of invariance testing and growth curve modeling. I’ve devoted a lot of time to missing data research. I've also done a lot of consulting where my personal mission is to provide investigators with responsive, efficient, and high quality analytical support across all phases of their research process from the early conceptualization phase through to publication. 


My goal here is to give you a better idea about how I think about and approach statistics. To do this I will summarize three examples of projects that highlight some of my previous work.
