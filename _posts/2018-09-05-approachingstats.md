I am a Quantitative Psychologist by training, which means that I’m trained in research methods, statistics and measurement. I have a number of areas that I have worked in over the last several years, mostly pertaining to longitudinal latent variable modeling; so I’ve done a lot of invariance testing and growth curve modeling. I've also done a lot of consulting where my personal mission is to provide investigators with responsive, efficient, and high quality analytical support across all phases of their research process from the early conceptualization phase through to publication. 

A researcher’s vision can be constrained by how they think about and use data. It is tough to watch researchers develop intricate theories about how the world works, which represent a lot of deep thinking about a topic, only to cut them up into smaller chunks that are then crammed into canned statistical procedures that were never designed to address the original question to begin with. Advanced statistical techniques allow us to ask more sophisticated questions.

My goal here is to give you a better idea about how I think about and approach statistics. To do this I will summarize three examples of projects that highlight some of my previous work.
