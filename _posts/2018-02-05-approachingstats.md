I am a psychologist by training. My PhD is in quantitative psychology, which means that I’m trained in research methods, statistics and measurement as it’s applied in the social, behavioral, and health sciences. I have a number of areas that I have worked in over the last several years, mostly pertaining to longitudinal latent variable modeling; so I’ve done a lot of invariance testing and growth curve modeling. I’ve also devoted a lot of time to statistical consulting where I provide responsive, efficient, and high-quality analytical support. To me this personal mission statement means collaborating with investigators on all phases of their research so that important theoretical innovations and ultimately the impact of the work are not limited by statistical ability. 

> I believe a researcher’s vision can be constrained by how they think about and use data. It is tough to watch researchers develop intricate theories about how the world works, which represent a lot of deep thinking about a topic, only to cut them up into smaller chunks that are then crammed into canned statistical procedures that were never designed to address the original question to begin with. Advanced statistical techniques allow us to ask more sophisticated questions.

This is a handwritten path diagram that demonstrates a lot of deep thinking about a topic.

I often get diagrams like this and I love to see them. What I want you to notice is that there is a lot going on here, we have multiple processes interacting in some really interesting ways. In this diagram you see the forest rather than the trees – which is to say that we are not focusing on one regression path or mean comparison here, rather we are looking into a complex system and all the effects are within the context of all the other pieces of the model. 

This is a plot of some data collected for this project.

Notice that each line represents a different form of communication – so the flat line is gesturing, the line above that is vocalizations, we also have single words and then multiple words. Look at how vocalizations seems to peak around 18 months than declines – at that peak notice how single words is accelerating – the idea here is that children transition from one communication strategy to another and this tool – can capture it. 

Now, previously these four forms of communication were summed to create a total score. Consider how much important information is lost when these scores are summed.
