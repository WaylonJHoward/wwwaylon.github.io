title: Leadership Building 
---

<span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.50em;">I have enjoyed many leadership positions throughout my career and believe that personal and professional relationships form the backbone of all sustainability and growth, and that a reflective focus on continuous improvement data informs good decision making.</span>

### <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">LEADERSHIP MISSION.</span> 

<span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">My mission as a leader is to support staff and systems to achieve sustainable growth in services, funding, staff/faculty satisfaction, and strategic partnerships.</span>   
   
To acomplish this, I focus on a number of critical leadership effectiveness efforts including: strategic planning, productivity and quality, funding and partnerships, reflection, and mentoring.

#### <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">PRODUCTIVITY AND QUALITY.</span>    
<span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">My **persional service mission** is to provide *responsive*, *efficient*, and *high-quality* analytical support. To accomplish this, I regularly collect detailed information about research activities. Analysis of these data typically invole the calculation of indicies that are helpful for assessment, for example:</span>   
   
* **Proportion of staff involved in grant submissions**
* **Number of projects per staff** and associated **weight** (workload) of each project
* **Number of grants, publications, submitted manuscripts, talks, posters,** and other forms of dissemination
* **Proportion of billable time** per staff relative to the position

These indicies are calculated at the group-level to evaluate overall group progress and at the individual-level to allow for individual progress assessments in comparison with previous results and with the anonymous results of other staff members. I am interested in influence and visability metrics within the orgainzation, the dicipline, and healthcare system more broadly and use automated procedures for indicators of productivity and impact (e.g., citation metrics, journal impact factor, etc.) using R, Google Scholar and other tools.
