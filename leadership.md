<span style="color:Indigo; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">I have enjoyed many leadership positions throughout my career and believe that personal and professional relationships form the backbone of all sustainability and growth, and that a reflective focus on continuous improvement data informs good decision making.</span>

<span style="color:Indigo; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">My mission as a leader is to support staff and systems to achieve sustainable growth in services, funding, staff/faculty satisfaction, and strategic partnerships. I believe that personal and professional relationships form the backbone of all sustainability and growth, and that a reflective focus on continuous improvement data informs good decision making. Toward these ends, I have focused on a number of critical leadership effectiveness efforts including: infrastructure, culture, training, partnerships, funding, publication, and reputation. </span>

<span style="color:Indigo; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">To accomplish this, I regualrly collect detailed information about research activity. Analysis of these data typically involes the calculations of indicies that are helpful for assessment, for example, the proportion of staff involved in grant submissions, the number of projects per staff, the number of grants, publications, manuscripts, talks, and posters, the proportion of billable time per staff. Such indicies are calculated for the group as a whole in order to assess progress in group-related research development as well as for each staff member to allow for individual progress assessments in comparison with previous results and with the anonymous results of other staff members. I also use R code to highlight the number and locations (as well as numerous citation metrics) in which team publications were cited. </span>
