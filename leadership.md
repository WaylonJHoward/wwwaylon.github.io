title: Leadership Building 
---

<span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.50em;">I have enjoyed many leadership positions throughout my career and believe that personal and professional relationships form the backbone of all sustainability and growth, and that a reflective focus on continuous improvement data informs good decision making.</span> 
<br/>  

### <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">LEADERSHIP MISSION.</span> 

<span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">My mission as a leader is to support staff and systems to achieve sustainable growth in services, funding, staff/faculty satisfaction, and strategic partnerships.</span>   
   
<span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">To acomplish this, I focus on a number of critical leadership effectiveness efforts including: strategic planning, productivity and quality, funding and partnerships, reflection, and mentoring.</span>

#### <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">PRODUCTIVITY AND QUALITY.</span>    
<span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">My **persional service mission** is to provide *responsive*, *efficient*, and *high-quality* analytical support. To accomplish this, I regularly collect detailed information about research activities. Analysis of these data typically invole the calculation of indicies that are helpful for assessment, for example:</span>   
   
* **Proportion of staff involved in grant submissions**
* **Number of projects per staff** and associated **weight** (workload) of each project
* **Number of grants, publications, talks, posters,** and other forms of dissemination
* **Stakeholder and peer qualitative feedback** 
* **Proportion of billable time** per staff relative to the position

<span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">These indicies are calculated at the group-level to evaluate overall group progress and at the individual-level to allow for individual progress assessments in comparison with previous results and with the anonymous results of other staff members. I am interested in influence and visability metrics within the orgainzation, the dicipline, and healthcare system more broadly and use automated procedures for indicators of productivity and impact (e.g., citation metrics, journal impact factor, etc.) using R, Google Scholar and other tools.</span>  

<span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">To illustrate consider a research support team that provides expert consulting on all manner of data collection, data management, and advanced statistical analyses. Our goal was to advance the quality of research by collaborating with investigators on all phases of their research projects - from planning to publication. Grant submissions consist of varied investigators, involved in varied activities, with varied experience. We provided leadership on challenging research problems by drafting methodology plans that prevent investigators from being limited by statistical ability. As shown in **Figure 1**, the team supported **65** grants during the final year (Oct. 2016 – Nov. 2017), an increase from **46** the previous year and **10** from my first year with the team (from July to October 2015).</span> <img align="left" width="600" height="300" src="/assets/img/BEEPacademics.png" alt="results plot"> </a> <span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">This substantial growth was accomplished in part by increases in efficiency due to experience, a developing library of grant templates and power analysis code, and increasing demand for this service. Also, we increased the percent of staff involved in grant submisions from **20%** in 2014-2015 to **80%** in 2016-2017 with **60%** of staff included as co-investigators on at least one grant proposal during the last year. Typical NIH grant reviews have described the analysis sections as “innovative”, “clear”, “well-reasoned and appropriate”, “well thought out”, and “clearly indicated in the proposal, in a highly detailed, concise manner”. Likewise, investigators have praised grant support we provided as “excellent”, “thoughtful”, “state-of-the-art”, and “perhaps the most thorough part of the grant”. By building leadership within the team, we were able to actively participate in the grant writing process and contribute to significantly more applications for research funding. As disucssed later, pre-award grant work required close resource management to ensure fiscal sustainability.</span>  

<span style="color:lightsteelblue4; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">Published manuscripts also increased with staff co-authorship from **5** in 2014-2015 to **31** publications in 2016-2017 (see Figure 1). Many of these publications were in top tier journals (some with an impact factor > 5). During my last year, team-authored publications had been cited a total of **783** times, with a median of **16.125** citations per staff member. In an effort to market the team's analytic services and build new partnerships, we also increased the number of professional talks to 5 during my last year. Overall, Figure 1 illustrates how I coalesced a new vision for the team within the organization, resulting in new funding, partnerships, and valuable skills among the analysts.</span>
