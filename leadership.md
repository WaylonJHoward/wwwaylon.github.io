<span style="color:Indigo; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">A researcher's vision is often constrained by how they think about and use data.</span> 

<span style="color:Indigo; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">It is tough to watch researchers develop intricate theories about how the world works, which represent a lot of deep thinking about a topic, only to cut them up into smaller chunks that are then crammed into canned statistical procedures that were never designed to address the original question to begin with.</span> 

<span style="color:Indigo; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">Methodological advances allow us to ask more sophisticated questions. But *how* do researchers stay current with advances in methodology and data analysis?</span>

<span style="color:Indigo; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">I </span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">**love** </span><span style="color:Indigo; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">to dig into all phases of research projects - from planning to publication. I work to identify and outline investment to build and maintain research capacity by **providing responsive, efficient, and high-quality analytical support**.</span>     
  
<span style="color:Indigo; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">My work includes multivariate approaches to measurement and analysis of substantive problems where I have led simulation-based research and contributed to recommendations for applied researchers. In addition, I have conducted substantive research using structural equation modeling techniques as a general data analytic approach to studying individual, developmental, and socio-contextual differences within the social, behavioral, and health sciences. I also have extensive grant experience in relation to study design, statistical analytic plans and power analyses.</span>

<span style="color:Indigo; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">To accomplish this, I support staff and systems to achieve sustainable growth in services, funding, satisfaction, and strategic partnerships.</span>    
  
<span style="color:Indigo; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">I have enjoyed many leadership positions throughout my career and believe that personal and professional relationships form the backbone of all sustainability and growth, and that a reflective focus on continuous improvement data informs good decision making.</span>
