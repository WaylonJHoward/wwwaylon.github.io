<span style="color:Indigo; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">My mission as a leader is to support staff and systems to achieve sustainable growth in services, funding, staff/faculty satisfaction, and strategic partnerships. I believe that personal and professional relationships form the backbone of all sustainability and growth, and that a reflective focus on continuous improvement data informs good decision making. Toward these ends, I have focused on a number of critical leadership effectiveness efforts including: infrastructure, culture, training, partnerships, funding, publication, and reputation. </span>
