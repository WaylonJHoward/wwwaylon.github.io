<span style="color:Indigo; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">I have enjoyed many leadership positions throughout my career and believe that personal and professional relationships form the backbone of all sustainability and growth, and that a reflective focus on continuous improvement data informs good decision making.</span>

<span style="color:Indigo; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">My mission as a leader is to support staff and systems to achieve sustainable growth in services, funding, staff/faculty satisfaction, and strategic partnerships. I believe that personal and professional relationships form the backbone of all sustainability and growth, and that a reflective focus on continuous improvement data informs good decision making. Toward these ends, I have focused on a number of critical leadership effectiveness efforts including: infrastructure, culture, training, partnerships, funding, publication, and reputation. </span>

<span style="color:Indigo; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;">To accomplish this, I regularly collect detailed information about research activities. Analysis of these data typically invole the calculation of indicies that are helpful for assessment, for example,</span> <span style="color:firebrick; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;"> the **proportion of staff involved in grant submissions**, the number of **projects per staff**, the number of **grants**, **publications**, **submitted manuscripts**, **talks**, and **posters**, and the **proportion of billable time** per staff. </span> <span style="color:Indigo; font-family:Palatino; font-size:1.25em;"> These indicies are calculated for the group as a whole in order to assess progress in group-related research development as well as for each staff member to allow for individual progress assessments in comparison with previous results and with the anonymous results of other staff members. I often use automated procedures for impact metrics (e.g., citation metrics, journal impact factor, etc.) using R and Google Scholar, providing an indication of the extent through which the team impacts the orgainzation, the dicipline, and healthcare system more broadly. </span>
